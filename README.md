### Code for constructing parameter graphs and running the model

See `gmn/`. The directory `gmn/graph_construct/` has functions for construction the parameter graphs. In `gmn/` there is code for the graph metanetworks to run on top of the parameter graphs.


### Code for Reproducing Experiments in the Paper

Still under NVIDIA internal approval process.
